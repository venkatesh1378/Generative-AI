              "\"Machine learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on the using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.\\n\\nMachine learning is typically the most mainstream type of AI technology in use around the world today. Some of the most common examples of machine learning that you may have interacted with in your day-to-day life include:\\n\\nRecommendation engines that suggest products, songs, or television shows to you, such as those found on Amazon, Spotify, or Netflix. \\n\\nSpeech recognition software that allows you to convert voice memos into text.\\n\\nA bank’s fraud detection services automatically flag suspicious transactions. \\n\\nSelf-driving cars and driver assistance features, such as blind-spot detection and automatic stopping, improve overall vehicle safety. \\n\\nHow does machine learning work? \\nMachine learning is both simple and complex. \\n\\nAt its core, the method simply uses algorithms – essentially lists of rules – adjusted and refined using past data sets to make predictions and categorizations when confronted with new data. For example, a machine learning algorithm may be “trained” on a data set consisting of thousands of images of flowers that are labeled with each of their different flower types so that it can then correctly identify a flower in a new photograph based on the differentiating characteristics it learned from other pictures.  \\n\\nTo ensure such algorithms work effectively, however, they must typically be refined many times until they accumulate a comprehensive list of instructions that allow them to function correctly. Algorithms that have been trained sufficiently eventually become “machine learning models,” which are essentially algorithms that have been trained to perform specific tasks like sorting images, predicting housing prices, or making chess moves. In some cases, algorithms are layered on top of each other to create complex networks that allow them to do increasingly complex, nuanced tasks like generating text and powering chatbots via a method known as “deep learning.”\\n\\nAs a result, although the general principles underlying machine learning are relatively straightforward, the models that are produced at the end of the process can be very elaborate and complex.  \\nTypes of machine learning \\nSeveral different types of machine learning power the many different digital goods and services we use every day. While each of these different types attempts to accomplish similar goals – to create machines and applications that can act without human oversight – the precise methods they use differ somewhat. \\n\\nTo help you get a better idea of how these types differ from one another, here’s an overview of the four different types of machine learning primarily in use today. \\n\\n1. Supervised machine learning \\nIn supervised machine learning, algorithms are trained on labeled data sets that include tags describing each piece of data. In other words, the algorithms are fed data that includes an “answer key” describing how the data should be interpreted. For example, an algorithm may be fed images of flowers that include tags for each flower type so that it will be able to identify the flower better again when fed a new photograph. \\n\\nSupervised machine learning is often used to create machine learning models used for prediction and classification purposes. \\n\\n2. Unsupervised machine learning \\nUnsupervised machine learning uses unlabeled data sets to train algorithms. In this process, the algorithm is fed data that doesn't include tags, which requires it to uncover patterns on its own without any outside guidance. For instance, an algorithm may be fed a large amount of unlabeled user data culled from a social media site in order to identify behavioral trends on the platform. \\n\\nUnsupervised machine learning is often used by researchers and data scientists to identify patterns within large, unlabeled data sets quickly and efficiently. \\n\\n3. Semi-supervised machine learning \\nSemi-supervised machine learning uses both unlabeled and labeled data sets to train algorithms. Generally, during semi-supervised machine learning, algorithms are first fed a small amount of labeled data to help direct their development and then fed much larger quantities of unlabeled data to complete the model. For example, an algorithm may be fed a smaller quantity of labeled speech data and then trained on a much larger set of unlabeled speech data in order to create a machine learning model capable of speech recognition. \\n\\nSemi-supervised machine learning is often employed to train algorithms for classification and prediction purposes in the event that large volumes of labeled data is unavailable. \\n\\n4. Reinforcement learning \\nReinforcement learning uses trial and error to train algorithms and create models. During the training process, algorithms operate in specific environments and then are provided with feedback following each outcome. Much like how a child learns, the algorithm slowly begins to acquire an understanding of its environment and begins to optimize actions to achieve particular outcomes. For instance, an algorithm may be optimized by playing successive games of chess, which allow it to learn from its past success and failures playing each game. \\n\\nReinforcement learning is often used to create algorithms that must effectively make sequences of decisions or actions to achieve their aims, such as playing a game or summarizing an entire text. \\nMachine learning benefits and risks \\nMachine learning is already transforming much of our world for the better. Today, the method is used to construct models capable of identifying cancer growths in medical scans, detecting fraudulent transactions, and even helping people learn languages. But, as with any new society-transforming technology, there are also potential dangers to know about. \\nBenefits of ML:\\nDecreased operational costs: AI and machine learning may help businesses to automate some of its jobs, causing overall operational costs to decrease.\\n\\nImproved operational efficiency and accuracy: Machine learning models are able to perform certain narrow tasks with extreme efficiency and accuracy, ensuring that some tasks are completed to a high degree in a timely manner.\\nImproved insights: Machine learning has the potential to quickly identify trends and patterns in large amounts of data that would be time consuming for humans. These insights can equip businesses, researchers, and society as a whole with new knowledge that has the potential to help them achieve their overall goals.\\t\\nDanger of ML:\\nJob layoffs: as some jobs are automated, workers in the impacted field will likely face layoffs that could force them to switch to a new career or risk long-term unemployment.\\nLack of human element: Models that are tasked with doing a very narrow task may also miss many of the “human” aspects of the job that are important to it but potentially overlooked by developers.\\nIngrained biases: Just like the humans that create them, machine learning models can exhibit bias due to the occasionally skewed data sets that they’re trained on.\\n\""

              "'NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is the branch of Artificial Intelligence that gives the ability to machine understand and process human languages. Human languages can be in the form of text or audio format.\\nNatural Language Processing started in 1950 When Alan Mathison Turing published an article in the name Computing Machinery and Intelligence. It is based on Artificial intelligence. It talks about automatic interpretation and generation of natural language. As the technology evolved, different approaches have come to deal with NLP tasks.\\nComponents of NLP\\nThere are two components of Natural Language Processing:\\nNatural Language Understanding\\nNatural Language Generation\\nApplications of NLP\\nThe applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:\\nText and speech processing like-Voice assistants – Alexa, Siri, etc.\\nText classification like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs\\nInformation extraction like-Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google\\nChatbot and Question Answering like:- website bots\\nLanguage Translation like:- Google Translate\\nText summarization \\nTokenization in natural language processing (NLP) is a technique that involves dividing a sentence or phrase into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can encompass words, dates, punctuation marks, or even fragments of words. The article aims to cover the fundamentals of tokenization, it’s types and use case.\\nWhat is Tokenization in NLP?\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, information engineering, and human-computer interaction. This field focuses on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is difficult to perform as the process of reading and understanding languages is far more complex than it seems at first glance. Tokenization is a foundation step in NLP pipeline that shapes the entire workflow.\\n\\nTokenization is the process of dividing a text into smaller units known as tokens. Tokens are typically words or sub-words in the context of natural language processing. Tokenization is a critical step in many NLP tasks, including text processing, language modelling, and machine translation. The process involves splitting a string, or text into a list of tokens. One can think of tokens as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.\\nTokenization involves using a tokenizer to segment unstructured data and natural language text into distinct chunks of information, treating them as different elements. The tokens within a document can be used as vector, transforming an unstructured text document into a numerical data structure suitable for machine learning. This rapid conversion enables the immediate utilization of these tokenized elements by a computer to initiate practical actions and responses. Alternatively, they may serve as features within a machine learning pipeline, prompting more sophisticated decision-making processes or behaviors.\\nTypes of Tokenization\\nTokenization can be classified into several types based on how the text is segmented. Here are some types of tokenization:\\n\\nWord Tokenization:\\nWord tokenization divides the text into individual words. Many NLP tasks use this approach, in which words are treated as the basic units of meaning.\\nSentence Tokenization:\\nThe text is segmented into sentences during sentence tokenization. This is useful for tasks requiring individual sentence analysis or processing.\\nSubword Tokenization:\\nSubword tokenization entails breaking down words into smaller units, which can be especially useful when dealing with morphologically rich languages or rare words.\\nCharacter Tokenization:\\nThis process divides the text into individual characters. This can be useful for modelling character-level language.\\n'"

It covers both basic and advanced concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the technology for both beginners and professionals. Whether you\\u2019re new to Deep Learning or have some experience with it, this tutorial will help you learn about different technologies of Deep Learning with ease.\\nWhat is Deep Learning?\\nDeep Learning is a part of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from lots of data without needing explicit programming. These networks are inspired by the human brain and can be used for things like recognizing images, understanding speech, and processing language. There are different types of deep learning networks, like feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Deep Learning needs lots of labeled data and powerful computers to work well, but it can achieve very good results in many applications.\\nApplication of Deep Learning\\nVirtual Assistants, Chatbots and robotics\\nSelf Driving Cars\\nNatural Language Processing\\nAutomatic Image Caption Generation\\nAutomatic Machine Translation\\n Artificial Neural Network: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of neural network that is based on a Feed-Forward strategy. It is called this because they pass information through the nodes continuously till it reaches the output node. This is also known as the simplest type of neural network. Some advantages of ANN :\\n\\nAbility to learn irrespective of the type of data (Linear or Non-Linear).\\nANN is highly volatile and serves best in financial time series forecasting.\\nSome disadvantages of ANN :\\n\\nThe simplest architecture makes it difficult to explain the behavior of the network.\\nThis network is dependent on hardware.\\n2. Biological Neural Network: Biological Neural Network (BNN) is a structure that consists of Synapse, dendrites, cell body, and axon. In this neural network, the processing is carried out by neurons. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, Soma sums all the incoming signals and axon transmits the signals to other cells. \\nSome advantages of BNN :  \\n\\nThe synapses are the input processing element.\\nIt is able to process highly complex parallel inputs.\\nSome disadvantages of BNN :\\n\\nThere is no controlling mechanism.\\nSpeed of processing is slow being it is complex.\\nDifferences between ANN and BNN :\\n\\nBiological Neural Networks (BNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are both composed of similar basic components, but there are some differences between them.\\n\\nNeurons: In both BNNs and ANNs, neurons are the basic building blocks that process and transmit information. However, BNN neurons are more complex and diverse than ANNs. In BNNs, neurons have multiple dendrites that receive input from multiple sources, and the axons transmit signals to other neurons, while in ANNs, neurons are simplified and usually only have a single output.\\nGradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function. In other words, gradient descent is an iterative algorithm that helps to find the optimal solution to a given problem.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will discuss gradient descent optimization in TensorFlow, a popular deep-learning framework. TensorFlow provides several optimizers that implement different variations of gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent.\\n\\nBefore diving into the details of gradient descent in TensorFlow, let\\u2019s first understand the basics of gradient descent and how it works.\\nGradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In other words, the gradient descent algorithm takes small steps in the direction opposite to the gradient of the function at the current point, with the goal of reaching a global minimum.\\nThe gradient of a function tells us the direction in which the function is increasing or decreasing the most. For example, if the gradient of a function is positive at a certain point, it means that the function is increasing at that point, and if the gradient is negative, it means that the function is decreasing at that point.\\n\\nThe gradient descent algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters of the function and then iteratively improves these guesses by taking small steps in the direction opposite to the gradient of the function at the current point. This process continues until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, where the gradient is zero (i.e., the function is not increasing or decreasing).\\nThe gradient descent algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the parameters of a function by taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function. The gradient of a function tells us the direction in which the function is increasing or decreasing the most. The gradient descent algorithm uses the gradient to update the parameters in the direction that reduces the value of the cost function.\\n\\nThe gradient descent algorithm works in the following way:\\n\\nInitialize the parameters of the function with some random values.\\nCalculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\\nUpdate the parameters by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, where the gradient is zero.\\nHere is a simple example to illustrate the gradient descent algorithm in action. Let\\u2019s say we have a function f(x) = x2, and we want to find the value of x that minimizes the function. We can use the gradient descent algorithm to find this value.\\nFirst, we initialize the value of x with some random value, say x = 3. Next, we calculate the gradient of the function with respect to x, which is 2x. In this case, the gradient is 6 (2 * 3). Since the gradient is positive, it means that the function is increasing at x = 3, and we need to take a step in the opposite direction to reduce the value of the function.\",\n          \"what is sql\\nSQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.\\nWhat is a Database?\\nBefore deep diving into this free SQL tutorial, let\\u2019s understand what a database is.\\nSo, data is the new fuel of this world, but data is unorganized information, so to organize that data, we make a database. A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.\\nWhy to Learn SQL?\\nSQL helps you to easily get information from data with high efficiency. To manipulate the data in databases like Create, Read, Edit, and Delete, we use SQL queries. Users can interact with data stored in relational database management systems. Anyone who knows the English language can easily write SQL queries. Some of the key features of SQL are given below:\\n\\nWithout a lot of coding knowledge, we can manage a database with SQL.\\nSQL works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, etc.\\nSimple and easy to learn.\\nSQL is an ANSI and ISO standard language for database manipulation.\\nSQL retrieves large amounts of data very fast.\\nSQL Basics\\nSQL or Structure Query Language is a fundamental skill for anyone who wants to interact with databases. This standard Query Language all users to create, manage, and retrieve data from relational databases. In this SQL tutorial PDF, we have listed all the basics of SQL. Explore this section to sharpen your SQL basics.\\nTables in SQL\\nThe cornerstone of any SQL database is the table. Basically, these structure functions is very similar to spreadsheets, which store data in very organized grid format. In this section, you will learn how to Create, Drop, Delete, and more related to Table.\\nSQL Queries\\nIn this section, you will learn about the SQL Queries like SELECT statement, SELECT LAST, and more.\\nSQL Clauses\\nUnlock the power of SQL Clauses with this SQL tutorial. Here in this section, you will learn how to use SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and more to query databases effectively.\\nSQL Operators\\nSQL Operators\\u201d refers to the fundamental symbols and keywords within the SQL that enable users to perform various operations and SQL AND, OR, LIKE, NOT, and more operators on databases. Here, we have discussed all the SQL operators in a detailed manner with examples.\\nSQL Aggregate Functions\\nWhether you are calculating the total sales revenue for a particular product, finding the average age of customers, or determining the highest value in a dataset, SQL Aggregate Functions make these tasks straightforward and manageable.\\nSQL Data Constraints\\nConstraints act as rules or conditions imposed on the data, dictating what values are permissible and what actions can be taken. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and coherence of the database by preventing errors. So, explore this section to get a hand on SQL Data Constraints.\\nSQL Joining Data\\nSQL joins serve as the weaver\\u2019s tool, allowing you to seamlessly merge data from multiple tables based on common threads. So explore this section to learn how to use JOIN command.\\nSQL Functions\\nSQL functions offer an efficient and versatile approach to data analysis. By leveraging these functions within your queries, you can enhance the depth and accuracy of your insights, transforming raw data into actionable knowledge.\\n\\nSQL Views\\nViews makes easier for anyone to access the information they need, without getting bogged down in complicated queries. Views also act like a helpful security guard, keeping the most sensitive information in the back room, while still allowing access to what\\u2019s needed.\\nSQL Indexes\\nIndexes work by organizing specific columns in a particular order, allowing the database to quickly pinpoint the information you need. And in this section, we have listed all the points that one has to learn while learning SQL.\\n\",\n          \"NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is the branch of Artificial Intelligence that gives the ability to machine understand and process human languages. Human languages can be in the form of text or audio format.\\nNatural Language Processing started in 1950 When Alan Mathison Turing published an article in the name Computing Machinery and Intelligence. It is based on Artificial intelligence. It talks about automatic interpretation and generation of natural language. As the technology evolved, different approaches have come to deal with NLP tasks.\\nComponents of NLP\\nThere are two components of Natural Language Processing:\\nNatural Language Understanding\\nNatural Language Generation\\nApplications of NLP\\nThe applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:\\nText and speech processing like-Voice assistants \\u2013 Alexa, Siri, etc.\\nText classification like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs\\nInformation extraction like-Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google\\nChatbot and Question Answering like:- website bots\\nLanguage Translation like:- Google Translate\\nText summarization \\nTokenization in natural language processing (NLP) is a technique that involves dividing a sentence or phrase into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can encompass words, dates, punctuation marks, or even fragments of words. The article aims to cover the fundamentals of tokenization, it\\u2019s types and use case.\\nWhat is Tokenization in NLP?\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, information engineering, and human-computer interaction. This field focuses on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is difficult to perform as the process of reading and understanding languages is far more complex than it seems at first glance. Tokenization is a foundation step in NLP pipeline that shapes the entire workflow.\\n\\nTokenization is the process of dividing a text into smaller units known as tokens. Tokens are typically words or sub-words in the context of natural language processing. Tokenization is a critical step in many NLP tasks, including text processing, language modelling, and machine translation. The process involves splitting a string, or text into a list of tokens. One can think of tokens as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.\\nTokenization involves using a tokenizer to segment unstructured data and natural language text into distinct chunks of information, treating them as different elements. The tokens within a document can be used as vector, transforming an unstructured text document into a numerical data structure suitable for machine learning. This rapid conversion enables the immediate utilization of these tokenized elements by a computer to initiate practical actions and responses. Alternatively, they may serve as features within a machine learning pipeline, prompting more sophisticated decision-making processes or behaviors.\\nTypes of Tokenization\\nTokenization can be classified into several types based on how the text is segmented. Here are some types of tokenization:\\n\\nWord Tokenization:\\nWord tokenization divides the text into individual words. Many NLP tasks use this approach, in which words are treated as the basic units of meaning.\\nSentence Tokenization:\\nThe text is segmented into sentences during sentence tokenization. This is useful for tasks requiring individual sentence analysis or processing.\\nSubword Tokenization:\\nSubword tokenization entails breaking down words into smaller units, which can be especially useful when dealing with morphologically rich languages or rare words.\\nCharacter Tokenization:\\nThis process divides the text into individual characters. This can be useful for modelling character-level language.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It covers both basic and advanced concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of the technology for both beginners and professionals. Whether you\\u2019re new to Deep Learning or have some experience with it, this tutorial will help you learn about different technologies of Deep Learning with ease.\\nWhat is Deep Learning?\\nDeep Learning is a part of Machine Learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn from lots of data without needing explicit programming. These networks are inspired by the human brain and can be used for things like recognizing images, understanding speech, and processing language. There are different types of deep learning networks, like feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. Deep Learning needs lots of labeled data and powerful computers to work well, but it can achieve very good results in many applications.\\nApplication of Deep Learning\\nVirtual Assistants, Chatbots and robotics\\nSelf Driving Cars\\nNatural Language Processing\\nAutomatic Image Caption Generation\\nAutomatic Machine Translation\\n Artificial Neural Network: Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of neural network that is based on a Feed-Forward strategy. It is called this because they pass information through the nodes continuously till it reaches the output node. This is also known as the simplest type of neural network. Some advantages of ANN :\\n\\nAbility to learn irrespective of the type of data (Linear or Non-Linear).\\nANN is highly volatile and serves best in financial time series forecasting.\\nSome disadvantages of ANN :\\n\\nThe simplest architecture makes it difficult to explain the behavior of the network.\\nThis network is dependent on hardware.\\n2. Biological Neural Network: Biological Neural Network (BNN) is a structure that consists of Synapse, dendrites, cell body, and axon. In this neural network, the processing is carried out by neurons. Dendrites receive signals from other neurons, Soma sums all the incoming signals and axon transmits the signals to other cells. \\nSome advantages of BNN :  \\n\\nThe synapses are the input processing element.\\nIt is able to process highly complex parallel inputs.\\nSome disadvantages of BNN :\\n\\nThere is no controlling mechanism.\\nSpeed of processing is slow being it is complex.\\nDifferences between ANN and BNN :\\n\\nBiological Neural Networks (BNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are both composed of similar basic components, but there are some differences between them.\\n\\nNeurons: In both BNNs and ANNs, neurons are the basic building blocks that process and transmit information. However, BNN neurons are more complex and diverse than ANNs. In BNNs, neurons have multiple dendrites that receive input from multiple sources, and the axons transmit signals to other neurons, while in ANNs, neurons are simplified and usually only have a single output.\\nGradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the values of parameters (coefficients) of a function (f) that minimizes a cost function. In other words, gradient descent is an iterative algorithm that helps to find the optimal solution to a given problem.\\n\\nIn this blog, we will discuss gradient descent optimization in TensorFlow, a popular deep-learning framework. TensorFlow provides several optimizers that implement different variations of gradient descent, such as stochastic gradient descent and mini-batch gradient descent.\\n\\nBefore diving into the details of gradient descent in TensorFlow, let\\u2019s first understand the basics of gradient descent and how it works.\\nGradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm that is used to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. In other words, the gradient descent algorithm takes small steps in the direction opposite to the gradient of the function at the current point, with the goal of reaching a global minimum.\\nThe gradient of a function tells us the direction in which the function is increasing or decreasing the most. For example, if the gradient of a function is positive at a certain point, it means that the function is increasing at that point, and if the gradient is negative, it means that the function is decreasing at that point.\\n\\nThe gradient descent algorithm starts with an initial guess for the parameters of the function and then iteratively improves these guesses by taking small steps in the direction opposite to the gradient of the function at the current point. This process continues until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, where the gradient is zero (i.e., the function is not increasing or decreasing).\\nThe gradient descent algorithm is an iterative algorithm that updates the parameters of a function by taking steps in the opposite direction of the gradient of the function. The gradient of a function tells us the direction in which the function is increasing or decreasing the most. The gradient descent algorithm uses the gradient to update the parameters in the direction that reduces the value of the cost function.\\n\\nThe gradient descent algorithm works in the following way:\\n\\nInitialize the parameters of the function with some random values.\\nCalculate the gradient of the cost function with respect to the parameters.\\nUpdate the parameters by taking a small step in the opposite direction of the gradient.\\nRepeat steps 2 and 3 until the algorithm reaches a local or global minimum, where the gradient is zero.\\nHere is a simple example to illustrate the gradient descent algorithm in action. Let\\u2019s say we have a function f(x) = x2, and we want to find the value of x that minimizes the function. We can use the gradient descent algorithm to find this value.\\nFirst, we initialize the value of x with some random value, say x = 3. Next, we calculate the gradient of the function with respect to x, which is 2x. In this case, the gradient is 6 (2 * 3). Since the gradient is positive, it means that the function is increasing at x = 3, and we need to take a step in the opposite direction to reduce the value of the function.\",\n          \"what is sql\\nSQL is a standard database language used to access and manipulate data in databases. SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL was developed by IBM Computer Scientists in the 1970s. By executing queries SQL can create, update, delete, and retrieve data in databases like MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, etc. Overall, SQL is a query language that communicates with databases.\\nWhat is a Database?\\nBefore deep diving into this free SQL tutorial, let\\u2019s understand what a database is.\\nSo, data is the new fuel of this world, but data is unorganized information, so to organize that data, we make a database. A database is an organized collection of structured data, usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Databases help us easily store, access, and manipulate data held on a computer.\\nWhy to Learn SQL?\\nSQL helps you to easily get information from data with high efficiency. To manipulate the data in databases like Create, Read, Edit, and Delete, we use SQL queries. Users can interact with data stored in relational database management systems. Anyone who knows the English language can easily write SQL queries. Some of the key features of SQL are given below:\\n\\nWithout a lot of coding knowledge, we can manage a database with SQL.\\nSQL works with database systems from Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, etc.\\nSimple and easy to learn.\\nSQL is an ANSI and ISO standard language for database manipulation.\\nSQL retrieves large amounts of data very fast.\\nSQL Basics\\nSQL or Structure Query Language is a fundamental skill for anyone who wants to interact with databases. This standard Query Language all users to create, manage, and retrieve data from relational databases. In this SQL tutorial PDF, we have listed all the basics of SQL. Explore this section to sharpen your SQL basics.\\nTables in SQL\\nThe cornerstone of any SQL database is the table. Basically, these structure functions is very similar to spreadsheets, which store data in very organized grid format. In this section, you will learn how to Create, Drop, Delete, and more related to Table.\\nSQL Queries\\nIn this section, you will learn about the SQL Queries like SELECT statement, SELECT LAST, and more.\\nSQL Clauses\\nUnlock the power of SQL Clauses with this SQL tutorial. Here in this section, you will learn how to use SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and more to query databases effectively.\\nSQL Operators\\nSQL Operators\\u201d refers to the fundamental symbols and keywords within the SQL that enable users to perform various operations and SQL AND, OR, LIKE, NOT, and more operators on databases. Here, we have discussed all the SQL operators in a detailed manner with examples.\\nSQL Aggregate Functions\\nWhether you are calculating the total sales revenue for a particular product, finding the average age of customers, or determining the highest value in a dataset, SQL Aggregate Functions make these tasks straightforward and manageable.\\nSQL Data Constraints\\nConstraints act as rules or conditions imposed on the data, dictating what values are permissible and what actions can be taken. They play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and coherence of the database by preventing errors. So, explore this section to get a hand on SQL Data Constraints.\\nSQL Joining Data\\nSQL joins serve as the weaver\\u2019s tool, allowing you to seamlessly merge data from multiple tables based on common threads. So explore this section to learn how to use JOIN command.\\nSQL Functions\\nSQL functions offer an efficient and versatile approach to data analysis. By leveraging these functions within your queries, you can enhance the depth and accuracy of your insights, transforming raw data into actionable knowledge.\\n\\nSQL Views\\nViews makes easier for anyone to access the information they need, without getting bogged down in complicated queries. Views also act like a helpful security guard, keeping the most sensitive information in the back room, while still allowing access to what\\u2019s needed.\\nSQL Indexes\\nIndexes work by organizing specific columns in a particular order, allowing the database to quickly pinpoint the information you need. And in this section, we have listed all the points that one has to learn while learning SQL.\\n\",\n          \"NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is the branch of Artificial Intelligence that gives the ability to machine understand and process human languages. Human languages can be in the form of text or audio format.\\nNatural Language Processing started in 1950 When Alan Mathison Turing published an article in the name Computing Machinery and Intelligence. It is based on Artificial intelligence. It talks about automatic interpretation and generation of natural language. As the technology evolved, different approaches have come to deal with NLP tasks.\\nComponents of NLP\\nThere are two components of Natural Language Processing:\\nNatural Language Understanding\\nNatural Language Generation\\nApplications of NLP\\nThe applications of Natural Language Processing are as follows:\\nText and speech processing like-Voice assistants \\u2013 Alexa, Siri, etc.\\nText classification like Grammarly, Microsoft Word, and Google Docs\\nInformation extraction like-Search engines like DuckDuckGo, Google\\nChatbot and Question Answering like:- website bots\\nLanguage Translation like:- Google Translate\\nText summarization \\nTokenization in natural language processing (NLP) is a technique that involves dividing a sentence or phrase into smaller units known as tokens. These tokens can encompass words, dates, punctuation marks, or even fragments of words. The article aims to cover the fundamentals of tokenization, it\\u2019s types and use case.\\nWhat is Tokenization in NLP?\\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, artificial intelligence, information engineering, and human-computer interaction. This field focuses on how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. It is difficult to perform as the process of reading and understanding languages is far more complex than it seems at first glance. Tokenization is a foundation step in NLP pipeline that shapes the entire workflow.\\n\\nTokenization is the process of dividing a text into smaller units known as tokens. Tokens are typically words or sub-words in the context of natural language processing. Tokenization is a critical step in many NLP tasks, including text processing, language modelling, and machine translation. The process involves splitting a string, or text into a list of tokens. One can think of tokens as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.\\nTokenization involves using a tokenizer to segment unstructured data and natural language text into distinct chunks of information, treating them as different elements. The tokens within a document can be used as vector, transforming an unstructured text document into a numerical data structure suitable for machine learning. This rapid conversion enables the immediate utilization of these tokenized elements by a computer to initiate practical actions and responses. Alternatively, they may serve as features within a machine learning pipeline, prompting more sophisticated decision-making processes or behaviors.\\nTypes of Tokenization\\nTokenization can be classified into several types based on how the text is segmented. Here are some types of tokenization:\\n\\nWord Tokenization:\\nWord tokenization divides the text into individual words. Many NLP tasks use this approach, in which words are treated as the basic units of meaning.\\nSentence Tokenization:\\nThe text is segmented into sentences during sentence tokenization. This is useful for tasks requiring individual sentence analysis or processing.\\nSubword Tokenization:\\nSubword tokenization entails breaking down words into smaller units, which can be especially useful when dealing with morphologically rich languages or rare words.\\nCharacter Tokenization:\\nThis process divides the text into individual characters. This can be useful for modelling character-level language.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Embeddings\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

This allows you to run Python code interactively in a shell or execute scripts directly without needing to compile them first.\n3. **High-level Language:** Python abstracts many low-level details, allowing programmers to focus on solving problems rather than dealing with system-level operations.\n4. **Dynamic Typing:** Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare variable types explicitly. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it.\n5. **Multi-paradigm:** Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n6. **Extensive Standard Library:** Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides modules and functions for a wide range of tasks, from working with files and networking to handling data structures and implementing algorithms.\n7. **Community and Ecosystem:** Python has a large and active community of developers who contribute to its growth by creating libraries, frameworks, and tools to extend its capabilities.\n8. **Cross-platform:** Python is available on all major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and can be used to develop applications that run on any platform."
